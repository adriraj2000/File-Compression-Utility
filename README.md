# About
A web app built for users to compress their text files. The user has a choice to compress his/her file using Huffman
or LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welc) algorithm. The input is a .txt file, while the the encoded output file is a .huff file when Huffman compression is selected and .lzw file for the LZW case. These files cannot be read and accessed by users. The website also displays the compression ratio acheived while performing the compression.The user can also decode their encoded file and acheive their original text file.
